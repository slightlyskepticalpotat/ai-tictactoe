# ai-tictactoe
Object-oriented console-based tic-tac-toe game that always plays the optimal move. To find the optimal move, it uses the [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) with [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning). There is also a move recommendation feature for those players who are new to tic-tac-toe. The setup of the program is flexible and can easily be extended to other connecting games like Gomuku and Connect Four.

A rewritten gui version made with pygame is available in the rewrite folder. It was developed as part of my coursework during [Harvard's CS50ai](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/), and includes properly licenced code from the course authors. Currently, it lacks the move recommendation feature for beginners.
